1. Dataset Gathering
    Since we've determined to use machine learning to separate email into three categories (Normal, Non-harmful Spam, Fraud/Phishing),
    we need to find dataset that contains these three categories. However, it is extremely difficult to do so, as we want to avoid using dataset
    that only contains Normal/Spam datapoints, since this will cause overlap in non-harmful and fraud/Phishing. So, we're only able to locate
    one dataset that has 50% Fruad/Phishing, 25% Commercial Spam, 25% Normal email. But the total number of datapoints are still way too small,
    thus we have decided to use a spam/ham dataset and label Fraud/Phishing from Non-harmful Spam by ourselve. 

    For the initial training, we started with using a simple SVM algorithm from SKlearn's SVC model. With that, we simply transform our email title
    and content to integers, then use that as input to fit the plot. However, as our datapoints are way too small, we're only getting an accuracy of 
    approximately 55%.
